Welcome to <b>Delta Lake Incubator</b>!

The Delta Lake project aims to unlock the power of the Delta Lake for as many users and projects as possible by providing native low-level APIs aimed at developers and integrators, as well as a high-level operations API that lets you query, inspect, and operate your Delta Lake with ease.  The <b>Delta Lake Incubator</b> org provides a location to collaborate on projects which want to enter the [Delta Lake project](https://delta.io).  

Please join the Delta Lake [Slack](https://go.delta.io/slack) for discussions; we also have a specific [Incubator](https://delta-users.slack.com/archives/C067GFWP5CK) channel.

## Incubator Inclusion Policy and Requirements
* Project should extend or enrich Delta Lake or the Delta Lake ecosystem
* Project should be open source or have a clear timeline to become open source
* Project must have a license of MIT or Apache Software License 2.0
* Project must be maintained by the person(s) proposing its inclusion in incubator. I.e. you cannot propose a project that's not "yours" to include
* Project must adhere to a code of conduct similar to the [one used for delta itself](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) contributor covenant

## How to join your project to Delta Incubator
If you are interested in submitting your project to `delta-incubator`, please start a conversation in the [contributors](https://delta-users.slack.com/archives/C03FVMHT93Q) channel pointing to your personal github repo.  It is recommended that your project:
* Refer to existing `delta` github issue (e.g., [delta](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues), [delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs/issues), etc.)
* Project has an existing PIP (Project Improvement Proposal) document
* Project is an already working project though early incubations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  

## Incubation Project Graduation
Project can graduate to the `Delta Lake` org following similar voting procedures.
* In general, the incubation project has been developed within `delta-incubator` for at least six (6) months

## Incubation Project Archival
We adopt a practice of marking unmaintained projects as public archived (with a notice soliciting new maintainers in the README) if there is no maintainer for the incubation project for 6 months.  We will follow the same voting procedures. 

## Voting Procedures
* A [Delta maintainer](https://delta.io/community) will call a vote for at least 72h on the [Incubator](https://delta-users.slack.com/archives/C067GFWP5CK) channel.
* The voting is open to the Delta community
* There must be at least three *maintainers* `+1` votes with no `-1` votes.
  * Note, as this is Slack, the +1 votes can be represented by green checkbox.
